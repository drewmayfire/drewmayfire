# About Me
Hi, I'm Andrei. I'm studying cybersecurity and focusing on low-level and systems programming. I'm particularly interested in Linux internals and security research, and aim to contribute to the Linux kernel and work in offensive security.

## Core Skills
- **Languages:** C, Rust, x86 Assembly, Bash, Python
- **Operating Systems:** Linux (Fedora, Arch), POSIX APIs
- **Low-level / Systems:** Linux kernel basics, loadable kernel modules (LKM), ELF format, process & memory model, syscalls
- **Security:** Security research fundamentals, privilege escalation concepts, threat modeling, red team tooling (educational)
- **Tooling:** Git, Vim, VSCodium, GDB, Make, CMake, Cargo, Rustup, CI/CD

## My projects
